In many grayscale images, there is usually a significant difference between the gray levels of the
focus of the image and the image’s background, this could be caused by the photo taken at a different time or
day, or other reasons for different lighting conditions. By using a statistical thresholding method, it is capable to
construct a new, binary image, which can enhance the viewing of two distinct classes. By computing an image
histogram, it is possible to segment the image into dark and light pixels, to compute an interclass difference. This
report examines the difference between two different image thresholding techniques: Otsu’s adaptive
thresholding technique, and adaptive progressive thresholding (APT).
